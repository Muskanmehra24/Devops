Life of Program is the life of Container.
hence when the program end the the container stops.

- docker run -it --name os1 centos date: Run and then stopped.
- docker run -it --name os1 --rm centos date : RUN and then it gets deleted.



If we want to do a thing continuosly again and again which cannot be done manually.In Docker if we want to do any automation then we can do using Docker Compose.
By using code in YAML ,nad the same setup run will shared van ne run easily.
curl -S ------------------
chmod +x /usr/  -----------

### YAML
- to give list:
 name:
	- "priyanshu"
	- "pop"
	- "tom"
key:value
name:
- "priyanshu"
- "rohan"
- "sagar"

## Docker Compose:
- Every container have a separate docker compose name apart from the container name,This is called Service Name.

docker-compose -f myfile up- one command and anything on the yml will get created.
docker-compose -f myfile ps

docker-compose.yml is the by default file name.

Till the time the container command gets executed then only the docker-compose command will get over.

or run everything in the detached mode
by:
docker-compose up -d(File name is not given bcz we wrote yml in the default file)..

service name will be usefull to know more about the container.
eg: docker-compose -f filename logs c1(service name).

Every Verion of Docker Compose is not compatible with every Docker Engine.
version check(https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/)

Hence its better to mention the version on the top to match the compatibilities with Docker.
