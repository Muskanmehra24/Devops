- Image created can be used by any tool such as podman,rocket,Crio etc.
- After every system reboot docker services are stoped.
 To enable it for after boot too : systemctl enable docker

- To run command inside container once:
docker run -it centos date
(Date command will run and the container will stop after that).This the real way we want container to run the program and terminate.
- Hence we can even use the custom  image to run the command and automatically run the program itself when we run the container,
  Using the cmd variable
  eg: cmd date
- here date is an runtime command and the life of the container is the life the program.

|CMD|                                              |RUN|
It runs at the runtime
As soon the container is launched             Run command run at the build time
In hardisk it is run                         That is when the image is building it will
                                              show ouput at bulding but not in the cont we launch 
                                             using the the image,Run on the RAM.
## Sharing custom image to other:
docker save myhttpd:v1 -0 myweb.tar 
- To save image in a tar file
## How tp use the tar file image
docker load -i myweb.tar
- Giving Image name is not important if no image name given then it'sgiven as none(Image Id is imp).
